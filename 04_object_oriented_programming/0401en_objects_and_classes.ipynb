    "This text explains the concept of a string as an object in Python and demonstrates some common operations that can be performed on strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "A string is a sequence of characters that represents textual information.\n",
    "- Just like any other object in Python, you can use the `type()` function to check the data type of a string. It will return `<class 'str'>`, indicating that it's a string.\n",
    "- You can use the `id()` function to check the memory location of a string object. This is useful for checking if two variables reference the same string in memory.\n",
    "- The `split()` method allows you to split a string into individual words or parts based on whitespace by default. It returns a list of substrings.\n",
    "- The `upper()` method can be used to convert a string to uppercase, making all characters in the string uppercase.\n",
    "- Strings in Python are ordered sequences of characters, and you can access individual characters by indexing them. The indexing starts from 0, so `greeting[0]` gives you the first character ('`H`') of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note:__ When sorting strings, Python uses alphabetical order, with uppercase letters coming before lowercase letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have the knowledge to work with strings as objects. \n",
