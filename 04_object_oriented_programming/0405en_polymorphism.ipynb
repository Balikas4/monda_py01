    "# Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "`Polymorphism` is one of the principles of object-oriented programming that allows one function or method to work with different objects. This means that several objects can be used in the same way, even though they have different types or implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Polymorphism` helps increase the flexibility, convenience, and organization of a program because the code is much easier to adapt to changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Overriding\n",
    "\n",
    "`Method overriding` is the ability to rewrite a parent class method in a derived class and provide it with a new implementation. This is possible because the derived class already has a method with the same name as the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Method overriding` allows us to have specialized classes that can modify or extend the functionality of the parent class without changing the parent class itself. The method in the derived class can also have additional arguments that are not necessary in the parent class."
